            <h4 id="text">Well hey! I'm Siddhi Agarkar. I come from Mumbai, Maharashtra. I was born in the year 2003, on the 1st of February in Pune. I have a passion for music, and intend to explore the field in the near future. My hobbies include singing, cycling and playing the guitar. From a young age itself, I was very fond of programming. I am currently exploring the fields of web development and competitive programming, and I wish to pursue my career in Computer Science. I consider myself to be a very enthusiastic learner, and enjoy learning new things, may it be a foreign language, musical instrument, or a sport I haven't played before!</h4>
